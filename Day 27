Greetings fellow apes!

We have come to the end of our recruitment drive and what a ride it has been! We are extremely grateful for all the help and dedication from each and every one of you. Your support has been nothing short of incredible and it has been an honor to fight alongside you in our mission to save ape-kind.

Although we don't know what the future holds, we can say that it has been an exciting and fun experience working together towards a common goal. Whatever happens, we can hold our heads high knowing that we have done our best to make a positive impact and create change.

Thank you again for all your efforts, and we hope that you will continue to support The Simian Path in the future. Together, we can make a difference and continue to fight for what we believe in.
