Path Recruitment Message 19

Date: 02/20/2023

Hello Everyone,

Happy day 19 of our recruitment drive! As we gear up for the big event in March, I just want to remind everyone to keep your wallets safe. Unfortunately, with the rise of NFTs, scammers are looking to take advantage of any opportunity to steal your hard-earned crypto. Please be sure to do your due diligence when signing messages.

On a brighter note, we are making incredible progress towards our goal. Our numbers continue to grow and we are excited to welcome all of our new recruits into the fold. As a community, we are stronger together and we cannot wait to see what amazing things we can accomplish.

So let's keep pushing forward and let's make this event a massive success. We won't let Doc Gibbons and his team stand in our way. Our determination and unity will ensure that we emerge victorious. Keep spreading the word and let's make history together!

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
