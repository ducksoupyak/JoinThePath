Path Recruitment Message 17

Date: 02/18/2023

Day 17, and I'm starting to wonder if this recruitment drive will ever end. It's like we're swimming in molasses, 
and I'm getting tired of it. On top of that, we can't trust Doc Gibbons anymore. 
Ever since he started wearing that radioactive suit instead of a lab coat,
he's been acting...strange. I don't know what he's up to, but I have a feeling it's not good.
We need to find some fresh blood for The Path, and fast. Our numbers are dwindling, 
and we can't afford to lose any more ground to the Applied Primate Lab. Let's make it happen, people.

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
