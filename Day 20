Path Recruitment Message 20

Date: 02/21/2023

Greetings All,

It's day 20 of our recruitment drive, and we are thrilled to see so many new members joining our ranks. We know that we've been asking a lot of you, but the continued growth of our community is essential for our success. We appreciate everyone who has been helping to spread the word and bring new members to our cause.
With the recent changes to our Discord roles, we wanted to take a moment to thank the hardworking Discord staff who keep our community running smoothly. We recognize that maintaining a safe and supportive space for all members takes a lot of work, and we are grateful for their efforts.
However, we would like to make a request demand. As some of you may be aware, we had a special channel in our Discord server for the original Chosen members. With that said, we would like to suggest the creation of an "OG-Chosen" role for our original Chosen members who joined us early on. It's a small gesture, but we believe that it would be a great way to honor those who have been on our side all along.
We understand that this may be a lot to ask, especially with all the other changes happening in our community. However, we hope that the Discord staff will consider our request and work with us to make it happen.

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
