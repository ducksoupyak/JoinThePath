Path Recruitment Message 16

Date: 02/17/2023

It's day 16 of our recruitment drive and I just wanted to say, I'm getting a little tired. But that's not going to stop us from pushing forward and continuing to build our community. We've accomplished a lot so far, but there's still work to be done.

If you haven't already, now is the time to join The Simian Path. We're a strong and supportive community, and we're always looking for new members to help us grow.

So let's keep pushing forward, and let's make these last few days of the recruitment drive count.

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
