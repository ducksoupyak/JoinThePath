Path Recruitment Message 5

Date: 02/06/2023

As we enter Day 5 of our recruitment drive, we have heard rumblings of individuals seeking to acquire multiple keycards, representing both The Path and Doc Gibbons' team.

We understand the temptation of having multiple options, but we must advise against this approach. True commitment and loyalty are critical to the success of our mission. Holding multiple keycards undermines this commitment and creates confusion and mistrust within our community.

At The Path, we believe in being true to our values and to ourselves. We ask that those considering joining us make a conscious and informed choice, choosing to align with either The Path or Doc Gibbons' team.

Together, we can achieve great things and make a positive impact on our world. We hope you will choose to join us on this journey.

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
