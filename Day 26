Path Recruitment Message 26

Date: 02/27/2023

As we head into the final days of our recruitment drive for The Simian Path, we want to remind you all how important these next couple of days will be for our efforts against Doc Gibbons. Every new member we recruit is another step closer to achieving our goals and putting a stop to Gibbons and his team once and for all.

We urge all of you to continue spreading the word and inviting your friends and family to join our community. Together, we can make a real difference and bring about a brighter future for ape-kind.

Thank you all for your support thus far, and let's finish strong in these final days of the recruitment drive!

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
