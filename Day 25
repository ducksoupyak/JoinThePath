Path Recruitment Message 25

Date: 02/26/2023

Greetings, fellow apes! It's day 25 of our recruitment drive and we're thrilled to see so many new members joining our cause. As we continue our mission to help and protect our primate kind, we want to extend a warm welcome to all who have joined us so far.

We know that there are many challenges ahead of us, including the threat posed by Doc Gibbons and his team. But with each new member who joins us, we become stronger and more united in our fight against them.

We are more than just a community of like-minded individuals. We are a movement that stands for something greater than ourselves. We believe in the power of collective action and that by working together, we can make a real difference in the world.

So, to all of our new members, we want to say thank you for choosing to join us on this journey. We're grateful for your support and we look forward to fighting alongside you as we continue to build a better future for all apes.


Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
