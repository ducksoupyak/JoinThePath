Path Recruitment Message 18

Date: 02/19/2023

It's day 18 and we're getting closer to our March event! However, there have been some sneak peeks leaked out to the world, and I'm getting worried that Doc Gibbon's team might be trying to undermine our efforts. But don't fret, my friends. We are stronger than ever, and our dedication to the Path will lead us to victory.

We must stay vigilant, keep our eyes on the prize, and never waver in our commitment to the cause. Our goal is to crush Gibbon's team and show them that the Path is the only way forward. Remember, we are a community that stands together, making decisions as one, and fighting for what we believe in.

As we get closer to the event, we need all hands on deck. We can't let Doc Gibbon's team get ahead of us. We must band together, bring our A-game, and show everyone what it means to be a true member of the Path. We will not be swayed, we will not be intimidated, and we will not falter.

Join us now and be part of the team that brings down Doc Gibbon's team. Together, we will rise to the challenge and come out victorious. The Path is the only way forward, and we will show the world what we are made of.

Together, we are unstoppable.

Join us and be a part of The Path.
